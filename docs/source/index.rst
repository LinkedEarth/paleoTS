Introduction
============

paleoTS is a framework for the analysis of paleoclimate data. paleoTS leverages an artificial intelligence system for time series analysis (`autoTS <https://knowledgecaptureanddiscovery.github.io/autoTS/>`_) and the `Pyleoclim <https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ Python package dedicated to the analysis of climate data.

Getting Started
===============

paleoTS was developed to allow scientists to analyze paleoclimate datasets using expert-designed workflows. paleoTS enables researchers to explore all possible choices of statistical methods appropriate for the data and, therefore, quantify the robustness of their conclusions to choices made in data pre-processing and analysis.
