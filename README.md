# paleoTS

This repository contains the documentation for PaleoTS, a paleoclimate-specific application of [autoTS](https://knowledgecaptureanddiscovery.github.io/autoTS/).

It also contains a copy of the environment used by PaleoTS, which is also used to build the container that is stored on [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/linkedearth/paleots?tab=tags). Since a new container is built every time we push to the repo, some images contain the same version of Pyleoclim. Below is a summary of version and tags:

| Pyleoclim version      | Image tags |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| v0.9.0      | 1739e52d17da; 261fb844badd;       |
| v0.9.1   | 41feefc10bf4; 43da87c597b1; 6570397d8779; 806650f8614b (latest)  |
