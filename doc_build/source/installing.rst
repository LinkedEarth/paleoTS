Installing paleoTS
==================

To install PaleoTS, you first need to `setup WINGS <https://www.wings-workflows.org/download.html>`_. Then you can add the PaleoTS domain by `following these instructions <https://www.wings-workflows.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#Managing_Domains>`_.

Note that example datasets will ship with the domain.
